                                    As a kid, I dreamed of becoming an artist, and my favorite hour of the week was
                                    during art class. I had a hard time during English classes - and math usually felt
                                    boring. I was not neither particularly good at memorizing or hitting furthest with a
                                    baseball racket. What I mean to say is: I didn't have the highest grade in math, and
                                    certainly not in any language. I was successful in subjects that caught my interest
                                    and I probably still work this way. You don't need to be a math-pro to become a
                                    developer or work in tech - you can both enjoy and be successful anyhow.

                            Today my hobbies include design (interior and graphic) color palettes and fonts, draw and
                            sketch, challenges that make me irritable, travel
                            and enjoy the sun, new experiences in everyday life and meet
                            interesting and committed people. ALL this exists in my everyday life as a
                            designer and web developer. I constantly have to challenge myself
                            and learn new things. Come up with ideas, re-evaluate, make mistakes
                            and do it all over again.

                            In the tech industry, I feel that I can be who I am - and my unique perspectives and
                            experiences are highlighted as a strength. How is the world from a women's perspective? What
                            would make my life easier with the help of tech? It is an advantage to have experienced
                            other cultures, communities, and industries. Then you're able to gain empathy and understand
                            the challenges the target group has. What would they need in the service och product we
                            create? I mean, how am I supposed to be able to create a digital service for a blind person
                            if I do not understand how they live, think and feel? It's nearly impossible if you don't
                            listen, ask and try to understand.

                                    technology was during a two years long web development program.</p>
                                <p>The other students were so different from me, I didn't feel that I fitted in and all
                                    the difficult English words and terms didn't make it any easier. It made me insecure
                                    and a little bit scared. I finished the education but didn't dare to continue that
                                    journey. But I gave it a second chance at Jönköping University, and started with a
                                    positive attitude - "I can do this" spirit. I spent many extra study hours in the
                                    beginning to learn the terms and logic - and fell in love with programming. The rush
                                    of happiness that comes when solving a problem is hard to beat.</p>

                                    Now I'm glad I've made the decision to learn how to code and the choice of the tech
                                    industry. It can be a struggle sometimes but don't give up. It is challenging for
                                    everyone. Programming is a language and everything requires practice - and you will
                                    never be fully learned. This allows you to always continue to develop and learn new
                                    things, which I think many are looking for in their future professional role.
